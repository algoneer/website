                </h2>
                <p>

                    and reliability of the site, to collect anonymous usage statistics and to

                <h2>Server Location &amp; Logging</h2>
                <p>
                    This website is hosted on a server in the European Union (EU). We do not record
                    any information about the IP address of visitors. The software packages on our
                    server are being updated regularly, accesses to the server as well as configuration
                    changes are being monitored and regularly reviewed.
                </p>
                <h2>Anonymized Visitor Statistics</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect anonymized visitor statistics for our website using Piwik/Matomo Analytics,
                    which we self-host on a server in the European Union. To perform the analysis
                    we use a Javascript-based tracking script as well as a static PHP script, both
                    hosted on <i>analytics.algoneer.org</i>. We only activate tracking if you
                    actively consent to it and we also honor the "Do Not Track" standard,
                    which allows you to disable the tracking through your browser settings.

                <p>
                    We use Cloudflare as a DNS and content delivery provider. This helps us among other things to protect
                    our IT infrastructure from attacks and infiltration by masking our servers IP
                    addresses. You can visit the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/" target="_blank">

                    Cloudflare might use non-optional Cookies for caching and security reasons and might also
                    perform CAPTCHA-based user authentication. These cookies are essential to ensure
                    the security and performance of our website and are not used for any other
